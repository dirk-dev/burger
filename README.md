# Eat a Burger

## Summary
The user enters burger(s) they would like to eat into the `Eat a Burger` app. The app does a `POST` of user input into a MySQL database and updates the screen to reflect any additions. There is also `schema.sql` & `seeds.sql` files to set up the database and add the initial values. 

Each item has a button that allows the user to chose a burger to 'devour'. Clicking that button triggers a `PUT`, which updates the values in the database to reflect that the burger has been eaten, and the screen is likewise updated.
